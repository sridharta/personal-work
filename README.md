# personal-work

#htmlllib.js contains the implementation of the modules of calcuation of salary and rendering the payslip in HTML.   Also there is an internal call of MoneyInWords which converts the rupees in number to words.
#work in progress :   There is a bug when the number is 67075 and number in words prints zero hundreds which needs to be validated.   
# also need to implement if the salary is > 100,000. Which is in progress.
